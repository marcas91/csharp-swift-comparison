# C# vs. Swift â€” Comparison of Protocol/Interface Extension methods

See https://medium.com/ios-os-x-development/swift-protocol-extension-method-dispatch-6a6bf270ba94#.6l37zbhv1 for a description of the behavior of extensions on protocols in Swift.

I found it interesting to compare this behavior to that of C# for extensions on interfaces to show that the Swift behavior is both expected and correct.
